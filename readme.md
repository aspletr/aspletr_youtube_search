i. The social topic I chose to search is eating healthy and working out tips.Both topics are very important in our society, if you don't eat healthy, you won't be healthy. If you don't workout in some sort of aspect, you won't be able to mentally and physically perform in certain situations. Hasving these two topics can be very important for the body and mind and can be overlooked easy with our busy lives, that's why it is so important to rember to do these things so we can stay healthy longer.

ii. I want to make the comparison to the two topics because both are different. Eating healthy allows you to be fueled for longer throughout the day and you won't be as tired and can be more awake. Being able to workout works both ytour body and mind, you're able to put yopur body to the test and try to be better each day at whatever exercise you want to do.

iii. The word clouds seem to have some similar words using nutrition, food, and diet. But other than those both are very different since both topics are much different from one another.

iv. The reason for the possible similar words could be that some healthy meals do go hand in hand with working oout. In order to gain proper muscle and maintain a healthy weight you should have healthy meals while working out.

v. The research could be improved in the future to narrow down the healthy foods for ewither muscle gain, low carb meals, fat free, etc. The working out topic could be improved by looking for ceratin areas to workout for the body.

vi. Something that stoodout to me was the amount of times social medaia paltform names popped up for the healthy food topic, not once did it pop up for the working out tips.
